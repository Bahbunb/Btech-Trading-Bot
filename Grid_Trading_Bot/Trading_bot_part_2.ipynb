    "# Brief Idea of Futures Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "The futures grid bot helps traders buy low and sell high, making profits by matching orders. When a buy order is executed, a new sell order is placed above it. Conversely, when a sell order is executed, a new buy order is placed underneath it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot buys low and sells high only within a certain price range. If the price goes beyond its limits, the bot stops trading until it returns to the specified range.\n",
    "While a bot offers potential benefits, futures trading comes with risks. The use of leverage can lead to significant losses in the event of unfavorable market conditions. In addition, if the margin falls below a predetermined level, liquidation may begin.\n",
    "\n",
    " Futures trading is based on a commitment to buy or sell a specific asset (such as a cryptocurrency) at a fixed price, but the actual transaction occurs on a set date in the future."
